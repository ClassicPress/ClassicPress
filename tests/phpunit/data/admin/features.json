				"description": "I suggest an improved media library, because this is a feature of WP which has been strongly neglected in the past. Whenever someone came up with a new proposal, most of it went under, unheard or was post-poned till somewhere in the far-off future. \n\nAt least having some option to display files and directories in a classic tree view would be great. Oh, and a slightly more welcoming Media API.\n\nBoth features would be very welcome. The former one should sooth newcomers, who are used to having a \"regular\" overview of their media, while the latter should rush forward plugin development.\n\n*Update (2018-12-18)*\n- Discussion on the forums at https://forums.classicpress.net/t/petititon-improved-media-library/411\n- Repository created for these improvements to start as a plugin:  https://github.com/ClassicPress-research/improved-media-library",

It would have been a great foundation to further build out CMS capabilities and probably many other things that we haven't even imagined yet.\n\nBut, the core developers don't need to imagine everything that people will do with our CMS, we just need to provide a solid base for people to build on.\n\nI see this API as mainly an un-opinionated way for plugins like ACF, Toolset, etc to do their job, but much more easily, without having to re-invent almost every piece of the functionality they provide.\n\nFor developers, this would also allow us to easily register all custom post types, fields, etc in the theme or plugin code for a site.  We would change the field definitions in our dev environment, test and deploy, and everything in production is already updated.  We could build a simple UI to manage only the settings that really need to be changed, but this UI wouldn't let users break the custom content types like what happens on sites today.\n\nFor users, it's hard to tell how this would look.  I think this would mostly be a back-end improvement, perhaps with some light UI controls, but most user-facing implementation would be up to plugins until clean standards emerge.",
