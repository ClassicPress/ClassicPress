The Python scripts are for generating test data, because Python's Unicode
support is much, much, much, much better than PHP's.

 * `utf-8/urlencode.py`, `utf-8/u-urlencode.py` and `utf-8/entitize.py` process UTF-8
   into a few different formats (%-encoding, %u-encoding, &#decimal;)
   and are used like normal UNIXy pipes.

   Try:

   `python urlencode.py < utf-8.txt > urlencoded.txt`
   `python u-urlencode.py < utf-8.txt > u-urlencoded.txt`
   `python entitize.py < utf-8.txt > entitized.txt`

  * `windows-1252.py` converts Windows-only smart-quotes and things
    into their unicode &#decimal reference; equivalents.
