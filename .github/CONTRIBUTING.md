# Contributions

ClassicPress is a volunteer-driven open source project that thrives when we have multiple contributors working towards a common goal. 

We invite all contributors to not only submit pull requests that are in line with the goals and direction of the project, but also to discuss and review other contributors' issues and pull requests. This will help us make the most of our limited time and review all contributions quickly.

Before contributing to this repository, please read our [Democracy page](https://www.classicpress.net/democracy/) to understand how we make decisions about what is included in ClassicPress, and our [roadmap](https://www.classicpress.net/roadmap/) to see what's already planned for the next couple of releases.

The **petitions process** mentioned in our Democracy document is very important to help us prioritize new features based on the needs of our users. There are some [exceptions](https://www.classicpress.net/democracy/#democracy-exceptions) to this process for minor changes and bugfixes, but generally speaking it is a good idea to search or ask in one of our communication channels (see below) before undertaking a change, because most changes should go through the petitions process.

Also, please be sure to follow our [code of conduct](https://www.classicpress.net/democracy/#democracy-conduct) in all interactions with ClassicPress community members.

## Communication channels

We encourage you to join and ask any questions you have about contributing.

- [Slack](https://www.classicpress.net/join-slack/) - great for real-time chat, posting screenshots and asking questions about anything you're stuck on. Or just socializing.
- [Petitions](https://forums.classicpress.net/c/governance/petitions/77) - for proposing new features or major changes for consideration by the community.
- [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ClassicPress/ClassicPress/issues) - for proposing or discussing bugfixes, or minor improvements. Generally it is a good idea to create a petition for anything that may take a significant amount of time or that may have backwards compatibility implications.
- [Forums](https://forums.classicpress.net/) - posting questions and searching for solutions. The forums are our most active community channel other than Slack.

## Review criteria

When evaluating bug fixes and other code changes in pull requests (PRs), we look for these things, ideally all of them:

  1. The change impacts existing ClassicPress users. Otherwise, there are literally thousands of things we could look at, but we need to prioritize our development time. Right now the best tool we have for this is [petitions](https://forums.classicpress.net/c/governance/petitions/77).
  2. The change is not going to break backward compatibility, and has minimal effects on the existing plugin and theme ecosystem. A good way to evaluate the effects of a change on plugins or themes is to do a search on [wpdirectory](https://wpdirectory.net). (Major changes are also a possibility but require a planning effort around when and how they will be released, as well as agreement from the community per our [democratic process](https://www.classicpress.net/democracy/).)
  3. The change has automated tests.
  4. We understand the code change very well or can ask questions of someone who understands it very well.

If your change meets all of these criteria then we will most likely accept it.

## What to work on?

If you're not sure where to start contributing, here are some ideas:

  - Review and test [existing PRs](https://github.com/ClassicPress/ClassicPress/pulls), especially looking at how well they fit the criteria described above. Let us know how you tested the changes and what you found. Screenshots, gifs, video and text instructions documenting the tests can be very useful. We need to be thorough and careful with any changes we make, and the more eyes we can get on our PRs the better.
  - Bugfixes, you can find a list of known bugs on our [issues page](https://github.com/ClassicPress/ClassicPress/issues).
  - Issues with the [`help wanted`](https://github.com/ClassicPress/ClassicPress/labels/help%20wanted) or [`good first issue`](https://github.com/ClassicPress/ClassicPress/labels/good%20first%20issue) labels.
  - [Planned Milestones](https://github.com/ClassicPress/ClassicPress/milestones) or exploratory PRs with your own suggested changes. Please remember these will be subject to review to make sure they are in line with the project's direction.

## Setting up Local Testing and Dev Environment
- Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your computer set up.
- For more advanced usage. Installing and setting up `grunt` and `phpunit` makes testing and running builds efficient.
- Fork ClassicPress if you plan to make any changes to the codebase.
- Clone your ClassicPress fork to your Computer using the command via your terminal or command prompt using

```
git clone https://github.com/{your-github-username}/ClassicPress
```
or

```
git clone https://github.com/ClassicPress/ClassicPress
```

if you did not clone the repo. (You can clone directly into your LAMP/LEMP stack or point a webserver at the resulting directory).
- Create a database to connect with your CP instance.
- Configure your MySQL database via the `wp-config.php` file in the root directory or follow the next step below.
- In your browser, go to the `src` directory on your localhost instance of CP to run the setup.
- That is it. You can now test the different git branches of your instance.

## More information

Here is some more information about a few subjects where we've noticed some frequent questions from contributors.

### Tips for good Pull Requests (PRs)

- A good pull request (PR) should be for a single, specific change. The change should be explained using the template provided on GitHub.

- Any new or modified code should have automated tests, especially if the way it works is at all complicated.

- It is always a good idea to look at the "Files" view on GitHub after submitting your PR to verify that the changes look as expected. Generally, there should be no "extra" changes that are not related to the purpose of your PR like reformatting or re-aligning files. Such changes are best done in a separate PR just for that purpose. If you see something that looks out of place, you can make an edit to fix it and push a new commit to your PR.

- Generally it is best to only use one pull request for each change, even if the initial code needs revision after review and feedback. Closing the initial pull request and opening a new one makes it more difficult to follow the history of the change, and it is much better to just update the existing PR in response to any feedback received.

- To be accepted, a PR **must** pass the automated tests (We use Github Actions to run these). Sometimes the tests experience unrelated failures, we will be happy to help resolve these. Usually, when this happens we start a separate PR to resolve the failure, and once that is merged, the following sequence of commands will get the build passing again for your PR:

```
git checkout your-pr-branch
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/develop
git push origin your-pr-branch
```

### Automated tests

Any change that introduces new code or changes behavior should have automated tests. These tests mostly use [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) to verify the behavior of the many thousands of lines of PHP code in ClassicPress.

If you're not familiar with automated tests, the concept is basically **code that runs other code** and verifies its behavior.

Documentation for running and updating our existing tests, as well as the code for the tests themselves, can be found in the [`tests/phpunit`](../tests/phpunit) subdirectory of this repository.

### Backporting changes from WordPress

ClassicPress version `1.0.0` is a fork of [WordPress `4.9.x`](https://github.com/ClassicPress/ClassicPress/tree/LAST_WP_COMMIT). Since then, a number of changes have been made to WordPress for performance, bugfixes or new features.

ClassicPress `1.x.x` is committed to keeping backward compatibility with the WordPress 4.9 branch. However, we're also open to merging bugfixes and enhancements from later versions of WordPress, **as long as the review criteria listed above are met**.

Changes must be proposed and reviewed **individually** - long lists of tickets or changesets from individual WordPress versions don't give us what we need in order to plan and understand each change well.

If you're not sure about any of that, then it's a good idea to ask first. A good way is to create an issue for the specific change you're interested in, along with links to the relevant WordPress changesets and tickets, and any other information you have about how the change works.

There are some changes that we already know we want to backport because they fit into our plans for future versions of ClassicPress. You can find some examples under the [`WP backport` label](https://github.com/ClassicPress/ClassicPress/labels/WP%20backport).

### Tips for a good Backport PR.
- Give the PRs a clear title. Explain in a pull request or issue what the specific change is, how it works and why ClassicPress in particular should adopt it. Often there is a lot of good discussion about each change in the relevant WordPress Trac tickets. It makes the maintainers' job much easier to see this discussion summarized and linked.
- Explain what testing has been done on the PR and what may be left to do. Screenshots, gif, video and text instructions documenting the tests can be very useful. Those tell other contributors looking at the PR how to verify the changes. "This was tested in WordPress" **is not enough** to meet our review criteria, see [Review Criteria](#review-criteria) above.
- Look to make sure the backport is done correctly, with attribution to the original WP committer. 
- If there are merge conflicts during the backport, check if they have been resolved correctly by comparing the final changes from the full PR against the corresponding WP changeset(s). Remember to fix these **in a separate commit**. If you cannot resolve the conflicts, ask for help in the [Core slack channel](https://www.classicpress.net/join-slack/) or just push your branch as-is and we'll take care of it!

### Making a Backport PR.
When you're ready to backport a code change, make a new branch to your ClassicPress fork using:
```
git checkout upstream/develop -B branch-name
```

See [how to set up local environment](#setting-up-local-testing-and-dev-environment).

1. Identify the WordPress **changeset number** that you'd like to port such as `43123`.
2. Run `bin/backport-wp-commit.sh` script in your terminal/command prompt.

```
bin/backport-wp-commit.sh CHANGESET_NUMBER
```
 to apply the change to the code. 
 
 If you're porting multiple changesets, you can use the `-c` option to this script 

```
bin/backport-wp-commit.sh -c CHANGESET_NUMBER
```
to apply all the changesets to the same branch. 

3. Resolve merge conflicts (if any)
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3
5. Then push your branch to your fork online using:
   
```
git checkout upstream/develop -B desired-branch-name
```
6. Use the online platform to make a PR to the `develop` branch for review.
!["Opening a PR to the develop branch"][open_pr_br_develop]

[open_pr_br_develop]: https://github.com/ClassicPress/ClassicPress/blob/develop/.github/images/open-pr-br-develop.png "Opening a PR to the develop branch"
   
Using this script for all backports saves time for you and for the maintainers. It uses a standardized format for commit messages, which makes it possible for us to track which WordPress changes we've already included.

**Note:** If there are merge conflicts for your changes, the script will let you know. Please fix the conflicts **in a separate commit** so that we can take a look at the conflicts and their fixes, or if you're not comfortable resolving merge conflicts, just push your branch as-is and we'll take care of it!

You can see a list of all WordPress changes since the fork, along with information about which ones have already been included in ClassicPress, at [backports.classicpress.net](https://backports.classicpress.net).

### How to review a PR
1. See [how to set up local dev environment above](#setting-up-local-testing-and-dev-environment)
2. Set up a remote link to the CP main repo as `upstream` in your git instance using
   ```
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ClassicPress/ClassicPress
   ```
3. Using the same technique above, you can add any other remote fork.
3. In your terminal run `git fetch upstream` to get latest updates.
4. Checkout of the branch with the changes you want to test using
  ```
  git checkout -b desired-branch-name <name-of-remote>/desired-branch-name
  ```
5. Run tests as PR suggests or stress test the PR.
6. Submit your feedback in the comment section of the same PR on the CP Github repo. Screenshots, gifs, video and text instructions documenting the tests can be very useful.
7. Thank you for reviewing the PR.
