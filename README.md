**WordPress without Gutenberg / React.js**

ClassicPress will start as a long term support (LTS) fork of WordPress 4.9.x with the goal of providing ongoing security patches, bug fixes and compatibility updates for at least 2 years, giving you peace of mind that the WordPress you know and love can be used for the foreseeable future.
