<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>For more information about installing ClassicPress, see our <a href="https://docs.classicpress.net/installing-classicpress/">installation documentation</a>.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Download the latest release of ClassicPress from our <a href="https://link.classicpress.net/releases/">releases page</a>.</li>
	<li>Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload all the files to your server using a remote connection method like SSH, SFTP, or FTP.</li>
	<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/install.php">wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in the browser. It will take you through the process to set up a <code>wp-config.php</code> file with the database connection details.
		<ol type="a">
			<li>If for some reason this doesn&#8217;t work: Open up <code>wp-config-sample.php</code> with a text editor and fill in the database connection details.</li>
			<li>Save the file as <code>wp-config.php</code> and upload it.</li>
			<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/install.php">wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in the browser.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed for the website. If there is an error, double check the <code>wp-config.php</code> file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the <a href="https://forums.classicpress.net/c/support" title="ClassicPress support">support forums</a> with as much data as you can gather.</li>
	<li><strong>If you did not enter a password, note the password given to you.</strong> If you did not provide a username, it will be <code>admin</code>.</li>
	<li>The installer should then go to the <a href="wp-login.php">login page</a>. Sign in with the username and password you chose during the installation. If a password was generated, it is possible to change it by clicking on the username in the top right corner after signing in.
