<p style="text-align: center">The business-focused CMS.<br>Powerful. Versatile. Predictable.</p>

<h2>A word from our Founder</h2>
<p>[we need a paragraph intro text from Scott for this]</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&#8212; Scott Bowler</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.</li>
	<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/install.php">wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in the browser. It will take you through the process to set up a <code>wp-config.php</code> file with the database connection details.
		<ol>
			<li>If for some reason this doesn&#8217;t work, don&#8217;t worry. It doesn&#8217;t work on all web hosts. Open up <code>wp-config-sample.php</code> with a text editor and fill in the database connection details.</li>
			<li>Save the file as <code>wp-config.php</code> and upload it.</li>
			<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/install.php">wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in the browser.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed for the website. If there is an error, double check the <code>wp-config.php</code> file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the <a href="https://forums.classicpress.net/c/support" title="ClassicPress support">support forums</a> with as much data as you can gather.</li>
	<li><strong>If you did not enter a password, note the password given to you.</strong> If you did not provide a username, it will be <code>admin</code>.</li>
	<li>The installer should then go to the <a href="wp-login.php">login page</a>. Sign in with the username and password you chose during the installation. If a password was generated, it is possible to change it by clicking on the username in the top right corner after signing in. It is also possible to reach this Profile page by navigating to &#8220;Users&#8221; in the sidebar navigation and then selecting &#8220;Your Profile&#8221; from the sub-menu.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Updating</h2>
<h3>Using the Automatic Updater</h3>
<p>If you are updating from beta version 1.0.0 or higher, you can use the automatic updater:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/update-core.php">wp-admin/update-core.php</a></span> in your browser and follow the instructions.</li>
	<li>That&#8217;s it!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Updating Manually</h3>
<p>Updating manually can be done via (S)FTP or via the admin panel of the web host (such as cPanel).</p>
<ol>
	<li>Before anything, make sure you to backup the entire site as well as the database.</li>
	<li>From the root of the WordPress install remove all files <strong>except</strong> `.htaccess`, `wp-config.php` and the entire `wp-content` folder. Also if there are any files present, such as google verification files, it is important to leave them too.</li>
	<li>Remove the `wp-content` folder from the installation package, then upload the rest to the root.</li>
	<li>Point the browser to <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/upgrade.php">/wp-admin/upgrade.php</a></span> and follow the instructions.</li>
</ol>
