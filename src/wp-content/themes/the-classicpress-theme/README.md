# The ClassicPress Theme

The ClassicPress Theme is the default ClassicPress theme and is based on the theme used on the ClassicPress website at https://www.classicpress.net. The ClassicPress Theme is designed to be used in three ways:
- as is, with customizations made using the Additional CSS box in the customizer and/or via plugins;
- as a starter theme, where you customize any of the code as you wish, provided that you also rename the theme and the directory in which it resides so that it does not get accidentally overwritten; or
- as a parent theme, which you customize by creating a child theme.

Please note that using the theme as-is or as a parent theme will mean that the theme may be updated from time to time alongside a ClassicPress update. This will not happen if you use it as a starter theme and re-name it as indicated above.

## Special Features
The ClassicPress Theme comes with two accessible menus. The top one is for the main navigation. It automatically becomes a mobile menu with a search box on narrow screens. There is also a menu for use in the footer, if desired.

The footer also contains a series of static links to various locations on social media. Feel free to edit them or to override them in a child theme, according to the customization method you have chosen above.

The theme enables widgets to be added to a right sidebar, while specifying one sidebar for posts (the Blog Sidebar) and another for pages (the Main Sidebar).

The ClassicPress Theme also comes with a ready-made template for Frequently Asked Questions. To make use of this, create a custom post type for FAQs, register the post type as 'faq', and specify a URL for its archive (e.g. 'has_archive' => 'faqs' ). The theme will then display your FAQs using accessible disclosure widgets. Just remember to create a Custom Link to the FAQs in your menu!
